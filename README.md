# Hack-along Holons - aka Team of teams

### Create and join teams, delegate appreciation, share the rewards!
--------

How can we value a plurality of stigmergic contributions and encourage open innovation? How can we enhance trust in open innovation? How can we warp the game from zero sum hackathons to positive sum hackalongs?

### Zero sum hackathons 

When collaborating at hackathons we've often noticed that the incentivatory power of the extrinsic motivator otherwise known as prize money, creates a zero-sum effect where teams become focused on their own thing and self isolate within their own group identity creating a number of pathologies. 

The boundaries go up and silos appear, if you win, then we loose - so why should we help you obtain the prize we want?... This is not what the crypto space was supposed to become - but the incongruency becomes apparent at every hackathon as we prioritise skills and roles that will help "our team" win. In a nutshell a scarcity mentality causes us to close our source and become inhuman silos.

Should the games we play in this space be zero-sum? We espouse "alignment of interests" at every turn but looking at our track record of hackathons we're completely incongruent.

### Positive sum Hackalongs - The appreciative soloution
Looking at the personas above, its pretty apparent that people want to get out of their silos - its just that the hackathon game needs warping. How can we make these events positive sum?

Our suggestion is to make them Hackalongs, not hackthons. Lets change the incentive model and put emphasis on valuing collaboration over competition!

**How can we do this?** Simple - we tokenise the most general form of value (peoples appreciation for eachother) and distribute prize money along these wighted trust lines! 

### Conrete example
Kay is a part of a team of four. They have decided to incentivise collaboration and assign 20% of their **potential** prize money to this cause. 

His friend Peter is also part of a team of four. They have also decided to incentivise collaboration and assign 20% of their **potential** prize money to this cause. 

While wandering off to grab a beer, Kay meets Peter who's team are lacking an idea still so Kay helps them get the ball rolling with his whacky ideas. The four members of Peters team sends Kay 50% of each members "appreciation budget". 

Kay returns to his team and finishes the hack they place first, while Peters team comes second. 

If 1st place is $500 then Kays team distributes 20% of that to who ever they assigned their appreciation to. Kay recieves $100 for his efforts there. 

If 2nd place is $250 and Peters team bugeted 20% of their prize money for appreciated contributions and Kay was delegated 50% of each members "appreciation allowance", then Kay will recieve 10% of the total prize money - an extra $25! 

Kay walks away a happy hacker with $125 total, a quarter more than his team members who just concentrated on their own work.
